## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: User Authentication, Song Creation (~1 day)
I will implement a simple authentication system using the practices . By the end of this phase, users will be able to create accounts, log in and out, and create song entries using a simple text form in a Rails view. The most important part of this phase will be pushing the app to Heroku and ensuring that everything works before moving on to phase 2.

[Details][phase-one]

### Phase 2: Uploading and Viewing Songs (~2 days)
I will add API routes to serve song data as JSON, then add Backbone
models and collections that fetch data from those routes. By the end of this
phase, users will be able to upload song files using Filepicker.io, view individual songs, listen through the default HTML5 audio player, and view a list of all songs on the index page, from a single-page backbone application.

[Details][phase-two]

### Phase 3: Song controls (~1 day)
I will add a Backbone `AudioPlayer` View, which should always be present within the single-page backbone application. When I reach the end of this phase, users should be able to click the play button on songs and have them start playing in the `AudioPlayer`, as well as being able to pause and unpause, change volume, and skip to a particular position in the track, all through custom controls in the `AudioPlayer` View.

[Details][phase-three]

### Phase 4: Feeds + Follows (~2 days)
I will include associated songs from the Tags and Users `show`, and create a composite view containing a `SongsIndex` subview, as well as the relevant information for the Tag or User at hand. In addition, I will add a `stream` route to Songs, to return songs in the tags and users followed by the current user.

[Details][phase-four]

### Phase 5: Searching for Songs and Users (~2 days)
I'll need to add `search` routes to both the Users and Songs controllers. On the
Backbone side, there will be a `SearchResults` composite view, containing
